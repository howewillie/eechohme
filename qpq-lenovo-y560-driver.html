Являюсь владельцем ноута 7740g уже месяц.На второй неделе ноут вырубился просто так и не подал признаков жизни ни от батареи ни от адаптера,причем вырубился не от игр а просто от мозиллы.Понес в сервис-короткое. Running Linux Mint 16 Cinnamon. Computer runs hot (CPU integrated graphics are doing the work right now), trying to enable the Mobility Radeon card. Current driver is the open source ATI/Radeon. the proprietary drivers crash X. Precautions: Timeshift Backup in case of emergency, with USB bootable on hand. So.how would I go about fixing. So, my old Lenovo y560 is slowly dying. I had it for about 5 years and shared many heartfelt moments with it. (Although Drivers were nearly impossible to obtain, heating was a major problem, the laptop casing was made out of cheap plastic and the right screen hinge broke after 2 years of use). I am considering to buy a gaming laptop next year. I'd prefer to build my own rig, but with my traveling it's nearly impossible. Are gaming laptops worth it? I'd prefer one with the gtx970 (or generally. Hi, I'm pretty desperate and I'm posting here after a whole day of looking for a solution with no success. I've got a Lenovo Y560 which has this GPU. After using it with no problems and good care for 5+ years, this morning I open the lid the computer comes up from standby and I'm greeted with a blank screen. After hours and hours of formatting, trying countless drivers, its always the same problem, as soon as the ATI driver is installed the screen goes black, and after restart it doesn't. 
I have a Lenovo Y560 (i5 M480, AMD Mobility 5000 + Intel HD Graphics). I just did the Windows 10 upgrade today and it all went smoothly except my HDMI output no longer seems to work. I have tried various things that I found on Google to no avail. ##Symptoms: The monitor "knows" it's plugged in (does not display "no signal"). Windows 10 does not detect an additional display When I manually hit "detect" it says "Another display not detected" and lists "Available display output Hello! So, I have a Lenovo IdeaPad Y560 that I got back in 2010. It's been a great little gaming laptop for me, and about 2 years ago, I upgraded to a solid state drive. Running win7 At the time, I didn't reinstall all of the little lenovo drivers for the built in media controller on the body and things like that. I would occassionaly get a blue screen and a "fatal erros has occured" but it kept working. A bit before x-mas, I got a blue screen, and then when I booted, it went into repair. Hello r/techsupport, about 5 years ago, I bought a lenovo y560 laptop. It was a beautiful piece of hardware (the screen hinges were bad though). However about 2 months ago, after downgrading from windows 10, I started getting BSOD's while gaming. Basically, the screen would go black, no fractures or anything, and then the bluescreen would appear. This would happen under any heavy load. Thankfully, the laptop has integrated graphics, so I was able to work on him. I already did multiple driver. I purchased a Lenovo Y560 in August last year and it worked perfectly for games in the beginning with smooth fps. But now it just lags even on the lowest graphics setting and I can't find out the problem. I've tried closing all other programs to minimize ram usage and turning the graphics from high to lowest settings but my friends who have laptops with Intel graphics cards run more smoothly than me on the lowest settings. I've also scanned for spyware, reinstalled both intel drivers Bit of background: I'm running a Lenovo Ideapad Y560, with Windows 7 (64bit) as its OS and an Intel i7 Quad Core processor (at 1.73 GHz). My graphics driver-- an ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5730-- has been crashing a lot. My screen will flicker, and sometimes it will recover (leading to a laggy mouse and monitor problems), but more often it crashes completely. Sometimes this leads to a BSOD but more often the whole screen just blacks out and I have to restart. I've tried everything-- updating For a while now I've been having an issue where I'd be working on the laptop and then my screen would dim and I'd see why and notice that my battery is almost flat. I would then pull out the power cord and put it back in and then my battery would start charging again. Yesterday the same thing happened but this time when I pulled the power cord out of the laptop and put it back in it would not charge at all. The battery is now completely flat and the laptop won't switch I have a Lenovo y560 laptop with i7 720qm, AMD 5730m. I've tried every possible driver available on a clean install of Windows 7 Ultimate x64. Everything works perfectly with standard VGA display driver. As soon as I install the official GPU drivers from Lenovo or any AMD driver set and reboot the problem comes back. The windows logo show up, then proceeds to a blank screen where it will sit there until I force power off. Safe mode works to roll-back the driver, but then I'm right back where. Hi, I got the following problem. My OS almost always shows a blackscreen after the bootlogo. I've already tried to format everything, install Windows 8.1 new. After installing older graphic drivers gt same problem. Even the ones came with my notebook are not working. I also tried to install Windows 7 and noticing the same problems here. After graphic drivers are installed it shows a black screen after bootlogo. Maybe 1 out of 10 tries it boots properly. The strange thing 
Hey guys, I'd really appreciate it if someone could fill me in on how to get this fixed. I just received my laptop back from a technician who cleared some soldering dust off the motherboard (the screen was going black before constantly) and now the computer works. However, my laptop seems to have reverted to the Intel integrated graphics and there is absolutely no trace of my Radeon switchable graphics options it used to have before. I went to the AMD website and downloaded the graphics I'm using a Lenovo Y560 laptop recieving wireless internet through an Apple Airport Extreme. Recently, my computer has begun disconnecting at random time for about 30-60 seconds. This is a sudden, and complete disconnection, this is zero lag before or after the disconnection. It's just gone, then returns as if nothing happend. This occurs when playing games and when browsing the internet. I have restored my computer to factory default and reinstalled/updated all wireless drivers. Specs: -Lenovo ideapad-Y560 -ATI Radeon HD 5700 series card (512 MB) -Switchable Graphics Intel -Windows 7 I updated my driver so I could get space engine to run on my computer and now it does but my computer no longer recognizes my second monitor (actually a Samsung TV). It work before I updated. The monitor does not show up in the device manager just one generic monitor. I also cannot find any setting in the Catalyst Control Center. I have tried restarting both monitor and computer You will have to find the most up to date drivers available and do some serious updating in addition to updating Windows, if you haven't. The BIOS update is the most problematic, hopefully you won't need to do that like I did. The reason I had to go so far was because I couldn't upgrade the driver for my ATI Mobility Radeon 5000 (on a Lenovo Ideapad Y560) without getting BSOD because of atikmdag.sys on Windows 7. This was happening because the Graphics Driver had a conflict with my outdated. I have a Lenovo Y560 Ideapad, and recently after not using the laptop for a while, the wifi stopped working. In the bios the wifi is on, the switch is on, and Fn+F5 does nothing. I have intel wifi 1000 drivers installed, and towards the end of last year, it worked fine. Any insight as to what could be the issue? Would a windows reformat possibly work? Thanks in advance. The heartache I have had to endure getting a brand new laptop replaced from Lenovo is almost surreal and traumatic to put it mildly. I should be suing for psychological damage the amount of stuff they have put me through. Here's my case, two months ago I bought a Y560 IdeaPad, within a week the display started to abruptly display a blue error message screen and would crash the computer unexpectedly, I didn't think this was a hard ware problem at the time (as I have never had this with a brand. 
Lenovo Y560, Windows 7x64, ATI Mobility Radeon 5700 series. It got unplugged last night, ran down the battery, hibernated, and then wouldn't restart. It powered on, but stayed on black screen.

Here are the specs: Lenovo Ideapad Y560 Windows 7 ATI Mobility Radeon 5700 series Intel i7 processor 8Gb ram It was most noticeable with certain programs at first, like flash video and non-3d games.

I replaced the drivers, no luck, dusted the inside with compressed air, monitored the temperatures, ran stress. sup reddit. aight, i have a problem. however, funny enough, i know exactly whats causing this, just. not the solution. there's some issue with the AMD/ATI drivers that's causing the video card to just flat-out not work. i can boot into safe mode fine; i can uninstall the AMD drivers and just use the generic VGA drivers fine. this only started happening yesterday, the fifth. before that, my laptop worked flawlessly for the nearly-three years sup reddit. aight, i have a problem. however, funny enough, i know exactly whats causing this, just. not the solution. there's some issue with the AMD/ATI drivers that's causing the video card to just flat-out not work. i can boot into safe mode fine; i can uninstall the AMD drivers and just use the generic VGA drivers fine. this only started happening yesterday, the fifth. before that, my laptop worked flawlessly for the nearly-three years I have a Lenovo ideapad y560 running windows 7. My headphone jack was working fine last night and when I got up this morning it appeared my driver crashed or was corrupt. I tried to adjust the volume and it said warning something is not working(something along those lines) it was the same thing that comes up when you have no drivers installed. I re installed my drivers and now the sound did come out of my speakers but not my headphone jack. My realtek recognizes that I plug in a headset Hey there! I have a Lenovo y560 from 2010. Recently, Final Fantasy XIV started doing this odd thing where it would freeze, flash a black screen, and then go back to normal. It wasn't a big deal, but it was really annoying. I asked around, and was told updating my GPU drivers would solve the problem, as someone who had the same issue reported it worked. Unfortunately, Lenovo stopped updating Y560 drivers in 2011. I looked around AMD's website, and found their mobility verification tool (http://.
